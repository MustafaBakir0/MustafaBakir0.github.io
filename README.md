# Redemption Through Reflection Movie Film Site

## Project Description

"Redemption Through Reflection" is a film website designed to enhance the storytelling experience through a modern cinema aesthetic. The project’s core visual theme revolves around sharp contrasts between black and white—white representing good, and black symbolizing bad. This distinct color scheme is intentionally abrupt, avoiding gradients to emphasize the sudden and transformative nature of Mustafa's character development. The goal was to create a space that visually reflects the film’s themes, reinforcing the emotional weight of the story through design.

Beyond the aesthetic, the website is meant to provide an immersive experience for viewers. The color shifts are not just stylistic choices but narrative devices, helping to convey the moral and psychological shifts taking place within the film. By aligning the visual design with the movie’s themes, the site becomes an extension of the film itself rather than just a hosting platform.

## Process

Developing this website was an insightful process that involved research, trial and error, and practical application of previously acquired skills. The initial phase of development consisted of gathering inspiration from modern film websites and studying how design choices influence user perception. I watched multiple tutorials to familiarize myself with effective layout structures and ways to enhance user experience.

A key aspect of this project was applying knowledge from my "Introduction to Interactive Media" course, particularly in JavaScript. This helped in implementing interactive elements, structuring content effectively, and understanding the role of different HTML and CSS components. Throughout the process, I also leveraged AI tools to refine my approach, clarify unknown elements, and ensure best practices in structuring the website. For instance, I was introduced to concepts like hero content, which played a significant role in shaping the site's visual hierarchy.

## Reflection and Evaluation

Going into this project, I had fairly low expectations for what I could accomplish. My wireframe reflected a basic and functional approach rather than an ambitious or intricate design. However, as I progressed, I became more confident in my ability to create something both visually engaging and thematically coherent. Looking at the final version now, I am genuinely surprised at how much I was able to achieve in just a short time.

That being said, there is always room for improvement. While the current version successfully communicates the core themes of the film, I see several opportunities for enhancement. Adding more pages to expand on different aspects of the film, incorporating more interactive elements, and refining the overall layout could elevate the user experience. One specific change I am considering is designing a "theater-style" frame around the video player to minimize the starkness of the white background, which may currently feel too harsh for viewers.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience. Not only did it improve my technical skills in web development, but it also deepened my understanding of how design choices can enhance storytelling. Moving forward, I hope to refine and expand upon this project, integrating more advanced features to create an even more immersive viewing experience.
