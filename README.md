# Redemption Through Reflection Movie Film Site

## Project Description

Hey there! Welcome to the "Redemption Through Reflection" movie site. This project is all about capturing a modern cinema vibe, using sharp contrasts between black and white to symbolize the battle between good and evil. The abrupt color changes are designed to mirror Mustafa's dramatic personal transformation in the film.

## Process

Creating this site was quite the journey! I dove into numerous tutorials to get a grip on contemporary web design. My background in JavaScript, thanks to my "Introduction to Interactive Media" course, came in handy for adding interactive features. Plus, I leaned on AI tools to help structure the site and introduce me to new concepts like hero content.

## Reflection and Evaluation

Honestly, at the start, I didn't set my expectations too high. My initial wireframes were pretty basic, and I wasn't sure how far I'd get. But looking at the final product now, I'm pleasantly surprised with how it turned out. Of course, there's always room for improvement. Adding more pages, incorporating interactive elements, or even designing a "theater" style frame around the video to make viewing more immersive are on my list for future enhancements.
