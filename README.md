# Redemption Through Reflection Movie Film Site

## Project Description

"Redemption Through Reflection" is a modern cinema-themed website designed to showcase a transformative narrative. The site employs a sharp monotone color scheme, utilizing white and black to symbolize good and bad, respectively. This deliberate choice aims to visually represent the protagonist Mustafa's profound shift in personality, with abrupt color transitions mirroring his journey.

## Process

The development of this website involved several key steps:

1. **Learning and Research:** Engaged with multiple tutorials to understand modern web design principles.
2. **Applying JavaScript Knowledge:** Leveraged skills acquired from the "Introduction to Interactive Media" course, particularly in JavaScript, to enhance interactivity.
3. **AI Assistance:** Utilized AI tools to structure the website effectively and to familiarize with unfamiliar tags, including the concept of hero content.

## Reflection and Evaluation

Initially, expectations were modest, as evidenced by the preliminary wireframe designs. However, the final outcome surpassed these anticipations, resulting in a website that effectively conveys the intended narrative. Future enhancements could include additional pages, more interactive elements, and designing a "theater" ambiance around the video to minimize the impact of the white background on viewers.
