## Resonance ## 

### Project Description: ###

Resonance is a short sci-fi film set in a future where people live with a constant buzzing in their ears — a low-level agony they can’t escape. In this world, music becomes both a cure and a craving, with each song offering temporary relief through colorful, vibrant waves. However, as people rely more on music to feel better, the lines blur between comfort and addiction. Through this story, we wanted to explore the dangers of drug abuse and the often overlooked addiction to constant musical stimulation. Our goal was to create an experience that felt intense, emotional, and a little unsettling, encouraging viewers to reflect on their own habits and sources of comfort.

### Process: 

At the beginning, our group — Deema, Mustafa, and Asr — focused on finding a meaningful idea that would really resonate with the viewer and encourage serious reflection. Our ideas shifted over time: we first thought about a story involving a young boy born with synesthesia, then considered a boy with color blindness, before finally developing the concept of showing the dangers of drug abuse through indirect yet powerful scenes. Yet, all of these topics showcase really important and serious issues that need to be acknowledged and discussed, and we were committed to show this.
We all collaborated closely during filming, making sure to choose our locations carefully so that the settings matched the emotions we wanted to capture. We took extra time to find areas around campus that could help us show a variety of colors naturally, using them intentionally to enhance different moods in the story when editing. We also paid special attention to making sure the filming was clear and visually strong, so that the emotions could be felt even without much dialogue. 
We also designed the website to match the emotional atmosphere of the film. We wanted viewers to slowly ease into the feeling of the story before watching the short film, which is why we decided to place the description of the project after the viewer watches the short film. This way, the viewer could first experience the emotions naturally and form their own interpretation before reading about our intended message. We believed that allowing people to connect with the story on their own terms would make it resonate with them more personally, since everyone could relate to it differently, even though the film carries one central idea. This is also why we chose specific colors and design elements for the website — to visually reflect the same moody, intense, and immersive vibe that Resonance aims to create.

### Reflection/Evaluation: ###

Looking back, we’re proud of how Resonance turned out. Our original goal was to create something that made people think about addiction in a different perspective, and we believe we captured that feeling. Some parts, like making the colors change with each song, designing the high-pitched sound to resemble a twisted version of silence, and building the overall ambiance through shifts in colors, effects, and music, really helped bring the emotional experience to life. These details made it easier for viewers to resonate with the story and feel the emotions of the character more deeply. Although some technical parts were challenging, the final version stayed true to our vision. We learned a lot about how sound, visuals, and storytelling work together to create a stronger emotional impact, and we’re happy with how everything came together.
